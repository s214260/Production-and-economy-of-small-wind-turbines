# Production-and-economy-of-small-wind-turbines
This repository goes over the special course "Production and Economy of Small Wind Turbines" by two DTU students with help from two DTU researchers. 

An introduction to the work performed is included in the PDF file containing the report. The code is part of the work we did throughout the spring of 2024. The code is part of a simulation with a given wind data set that tackled the various subjects of the course. 

The work is performed in Danish with the course material being a hybrid of Danish and English.
